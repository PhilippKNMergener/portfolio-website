      I have loved computers for as long as I can remember. From writing my
      first lines of JavaScript at 12 to building my first computer at 14, I was
      always fascinated of what was possible with just 1s and 0s and a little
      determination. Whenever I played video games with friends I was accutely
      aware that under the hood, the application, files, scripts, function, it
      was all just millions of true or false, all coming together to create a
      world so elaborate that we got lost in it for hours. Now it is my turn to
      string together logic and algorithms, to create a positive impact on
      others.
