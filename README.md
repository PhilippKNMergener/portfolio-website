# Personal Portfolio Website

_Created With React.js_

## About the Project

This is my personal website which I intend to use for proffessional inquiries and job applications. It is built using React.js and Sass for styling. I also intend to host this on a custom domain once it is completed.

## Why am I building it from scratch?

I decided to build this website, not only because I wanted a personal portfolio website, but also as an ongoing learning oportunity which I can continuously uprage throughout my journey of learning web development.
